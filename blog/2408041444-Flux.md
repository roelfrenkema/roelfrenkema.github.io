# FLUX is great but not ready.

## First impression.

I am glad to see the team is back. The makers of SD and SDXL presented FLUX a few days ago. I imidiatly gave it a testrun on github and was impressed.
Now I have it running FLUX1 Schnell at home and had a better look at it. And it is great all the way. It looks like the new professional model to go.

## It does text.

Something Stablility AI said SD3 would do but really failed and killed the launch. I gave it a few runs and is just does what ask for.

## Anatomy.

It is a SFW model so no rendering nudes. Hands are ok, incidentially you get limbs mingled. But less the SD3 or even SDXL.

## Textures.

Here the model shows it is not finished yet. Skin texture is really more Dall-E and MidJourney like.

Images above show what I mean. Left my favorite SDXL model right FLUX

## IMHO

This model is going to be a winner if it can loose the Dall-e/MidJourney impressions. I have no daubt it will as there is a team behind it that works with academic precision.
